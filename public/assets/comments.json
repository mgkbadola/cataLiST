We had no gas or electricity, so my mom had an extension cord from the neighbor and would warm up large bowls of water in the microwave.</p>\n\n<p>It sucked but my mom made games out of it and I have some good memories from that time. </p>\n\n<p>Another memory is coming home after being gone a while and our place being torn apart from a robbery and our microwave was gone. She was just recovering from that when she got a phone bill, the thieves had made several <del>collect</del> long-distance calls.</p>\n\n<p>As a mom myself now, the anger I had towards her (I spent time in foster care) has been replaced by wonderment at her perseverance. She must have been about 21 years old at the time and was completely on her own.</p>\n</div>",
